# ur10_trajectory_optimisation
Goal is to optimise the waypoints (free-trajectories). Sort the waypoints in such a way that ur10 robot manipulator can reach all of them in shorted point. The algorithm used here is the travelling salesman problem with heuristic approach that seeks nearest neighbour after visiting each point and marks it as visited.
